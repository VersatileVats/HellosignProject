# HellosignProject
The most advanced projected equipped with the e-signature facility provided by HelloSign

As I have said in the Devpost's project decsription I will be leaving the voice-assistant video in this readme. So, do go through it as it is also a really important part of the application.

I have captured it using Dropbox Capture and what I found that it was having some problems in capturing the system's sound and that is why in the video sometimes you hear beeped sound when Alan is giving out responses.

Also, as I have laready mentioned in the devpost docuemntation, that there are 3 instances where I am using HelloWorks/HelloSign. And the snippet of their workflows are presnet below:

The files mentioned in the snippets are the ones handling all the BETA SDK & API Calls for HelloSign and HelloWorks.
